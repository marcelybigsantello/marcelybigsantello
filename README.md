- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcelybigsantello
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and expading horizons in backend programming languages, such as Java and C#. Developing some personal projects is considered a hobby and I like it a lot! 
- 💞️ I’m improving my English communication, listening, reading skills. In fact, studying English is a passion and I also consider as a hobby. 
Thinking in another language, which is different from your mother-tongue, helps to expand your mind and to perceive life in a complete new way.
